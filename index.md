##Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

*Lab 1, part 1 

Was a fun experinece because it was the main introduction to coding. Learning the basic is always a good part to start and it helps out for the more challenging labs later on. During Lab 1 it was nice to know the start off of clang++ and how to get to end to understand git push, git add, and git commit to feel the flow of coding.

*Lab 6, part 1 

Is my second favorite because it brought out the attention to make a sandwhich, and we have to code the order of how to build a sandwich. Also I enjoyed this lab is because it showed us a way to deal with more than one arguement.

*Lab 7, part 1 

Is my third favorite because it had the used of coding the days of the week and the time when being able to park in a parking spot. I found the coding to be easier because with the read me it was easy to understand the steps of what day goes with time. Also this lab gave us picture to go base off which help out so much.
